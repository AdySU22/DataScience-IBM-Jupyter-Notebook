# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb**. The notebook provides an overview of various tools and concepts in the data science ecosystem, including popular programming languages, libraries, and development environments. The notebook also includes practical examples of arithmetic operations in Python.

## Objectives:
**In this notebook, we aim to:**
- **Understand Key Data Science Concepts**: Gain a foundational understanding of data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Explore Popular Data Science Languages**: Identify and discuss commonly used programming languages in data science such as Python, R, SQL, and Julia.
- **List Popular Languages for Data Science**: Provide an overview of the importance and features of popular data science languages.
- **Learn About Data Science Tools and Libraries**: Familiarize with essential tools and libraries like Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Apache Zeppelin, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
- **Perform Arithmetic and Data Manipulation**: Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python and convert units (e.g., minutes to hours).
- **Evaluate and Visualize Data**: Learn evaluation and visualization techniques to effectively represent data insights.
- **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**: Enhance problem-solving abilities through coding exercises and challenges.
